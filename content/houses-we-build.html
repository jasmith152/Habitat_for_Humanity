The typical house has approximately 1,173 square feet of furnished living area, set on varying size lots in quiet neighborhoods. Most houses have three bedrooms with 1 3/4 baths, a covered front entry and paved driveway, but no garage or carport. A kitchen stove and refrigerator are supplied by the Whirlpool Corporation for every Habitat home.<br />
