Habitat invites people from all walks of life to work together in partnership to build houses with families in need.</p>
											<p>Since our founding in 1993, HFHCC has increased the number of houses we build each year in Inverness, Crystal River, Homosassa and Hernando. Blessed with the support of benefactors, churches, businesses, civic organizations and others, we are on track to complete 100 houses by our 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2013.</p>
											<p>Habitat for Humanity is not a charity or a give-away program. Partner families pay a small down payment and maintain a no-interest mortgage. They also invest hundreds of hours of labor&#151;sweat equity&#151;into building their own homes and the homes of others. They work alongside generous Habitat volunteers who donate time, skills and energy to help build the houses.</p>
											<p>We are people from different faiths, diverse backgrounds, and many economic levels. We work toward a common goal, honoring the dignity of each person by helping each one secure a safe and decent place to live.</p>
