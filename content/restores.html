										<div align="left">
											<p><img src="images/volunteer/restore-desk.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="262" align="right" border="0" />To begin Volunteering with the ReStore, potential volunteers are asked to contact either store manager directly. Call Tim Schwartz in Inverness at 352-341-1800 or Terri Ruttman in Crystal River at 352-564-2300.&nbsp;</p>
											<p><strong>Scheduling:</strong></p>
											<p>In-Store Volunteers are needed at all times while the ReStore is open.&nbsp; Hours of operation are Monday-Saturday from 9:00am-5:00pm.&nbsp; Volunteers are asked to work a shift from 9:00-1:00 or 1:00-5:00 whenever possible.&nbsp; Flexibility from these times is allowed in accordance with the needs of the individual volunteer.</p>
											<p><strong>Age Requirements:</strong></p>
											<p>In-Store Volunteers must be at least 16 years of age.&nbsp; All Volunteers between the ages of 16-18 will be met with in advance to determine if the ReStore is a good fit for their volunteering interests.&nbsp; They will also need a parent or guardian to sign their Liability Waiver before they can begin volunteering.&nbsp; The Waiver is available from the Coordinator of Volunteers, CD Perez at 352-563-2744 or <a href="mailto:cdperez19@gmail.com">cdperez19@gmail.com</a>.</p>
											<p><strong>Dress Code:</strong></p>
											<p>Volunteers must wear closed-toed shoes and be dressed comfortably and appropriately for their performance of duties.&nbsp; Inappropriate clothing includes offensive images or words, sagging pants, shorts shorter than mid-thigh, low-cut shirts.</p>
											<p><strong>Validation of Hours:</strong></p>
											<p>All volunteers are asked to sign in on arrival and log their hours on a timesheet.&nbsp; This action makes it easy to validate a volunteer&rsquo;s hours if need be.&nbsp; So, if you&rsquo;re tracking hours for your resume, for school requirements, for Habitat ownership, or for other purposes, we are pleased to accommodate you!</p>
											<p><strong>One-Time or Short-Term Experiences (Individual or Group):</strong></p>
											<p>There are many tasks that can be done in the store without a long-term commitment.&nbsp; To see such tasks and learn more about a one-time or short-term experience, please contact the Volunteer Coordinator, CD Perez, at 352-563-2744 or <a href="mailto:cdperez19@gmail.com">cdperez19@gmail.com</a> for suggestions and scheduling.</p>
