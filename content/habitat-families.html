After going through a divorce, Kristen&rsquo;s world turned upside down. She still kept her job, but she lost her house&#x2026;the house where her kids felt safe, the house that provided stability and helped keep her family together.</p>
											<p>In January 2010, Kristen heard about the Habitat for Humanity&rsquo;s orientation and went to listen. She was intrigued, but did not fill out the application. She&rsquo;d heard of the good work Habitat had done with affordable housing, but she wasn&rsquo;t sure it was for her. After research and soul searching, Kristen went to another orientation and applied. She is so glad she did.</p>
											<p>Her first day at the construction site of her new home was intimidating. Kristen didn&rsquo;t even know how to swing a hammer. She says, &ldquo;Everyone was so helpful. They showed you how to do things. They were terrific teachers.&rdquo;</p>
											<p>Kristin said, &ldquo;It really is an inspiring program. Habitat changed my life. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. It was so hard on my kids to be living with family members. But when we got a Habitat house, it really benefitted them. Their schoolwork and their attitudes improved.&rdquo;</p>
											<p>&ldquo;The people at Habitat are some of the most unselfish people I&rsquo;ve ever met. They are committed to having people do well for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
											<p>Kristen&rsquo;s house was dedicated in June 2011.</p>
