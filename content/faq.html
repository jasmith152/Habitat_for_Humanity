										<ul>
											<div align="left">
												<li>A nonprofit, ecumenical <a href="mission.php">Christian housing ministry</a>.</li>
												<li>We seek to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness from the world and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action.</li>
												<li>To accomplish these goals, we invite people of all backgrounds, races and religions to build houses together in partnership with families in need.</li>
												<li> Habitat for Humanity was founded in 1976 by <a href="(EmptyReference!)">Millard Fuller</a>, along with his wife, <a href="(EmptyReference!)">Linda</a>.</li>
												<li>Today, we have helped build over 400,000 decent, affordable houses and served more than 2 million people around the world.</li>

													<font size="4">How does it work?</font></b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Through <a href="volunteer.php">volunteer</a> labor and <a href="donate.php">donations of money</a> and <a href="restores-donate.php">materials</a>, Habitat builds and rehabilitates <a href="(EmptyReference!)">simple, decent houses</a> alongside our <a href="(EmptyReference!)">homeowner (partner) families.</a></li>
												<li>Habitat is not a giveaway program. In addition to a down payment and monthly mortgage payments, homeowners invest hundreds of hours of their own labor (sweat equity) into building their Habitat house and the houses of others.</li>
												<li>Habitat houses are sold to partner families at no profit and financed with affordable loans.</li>
												<li>The homeowners&rsquo; monthly mortgage payments are used to build still more Habitat houses.</li>
											</ul>
											<p><b><font size="4">How are partner families selected?</font></b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Families in need of decent shelter <a href="how-to-apply.php">apply</a> to local Habitat affiliates.</li>
												<li>The affiliate&rsquo;s family selection committee chooses homeowners based on their level of need, their willingness to become partners in the program and their ability to repay the loan.</li>
												<li>Every affiliate follows a nondiscriminatory policy of family selection.</li>
												<li>Neither race nor religion is a factor in choosing the families who receive Habitat houses.</li>
											</ul>
											<p><b><strong><font size="4">What are Habitat affiliates?</font></strong></b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Community-level Habitat for Humanity offices that act in partnership with and on behalf of Habitat for Humanity International.</li>

											<p><b><font size="4">How does Habitat work with the government?</font></b></p>
											<ul>
												<li>Our <a href="(EmptyReference!)">Government Relations and Advocacy</a> team works with legislators and housing regulators to increase support for affordable homeownership and eliminate poverty housing.</li>
												<li>We monitor <a href="(EmptyReference!)">public policies</a> related to housing, community and international development.</li>
												<li>We advocate policy choices that increase access to decent, affordable housing for people around the world.</li>
												<li>We accept government funds for infrastructure, utilities, capacity building or training, and house building. We accept these funds so long as they have no conditions that would violate Habitat&rsquo;s principles or limit its ability to proclaim its Christian identity.</li>
											</ul>
											<p><b><font size="4">How does a Habitat for Humanity affiliate get started?</font></b></p>
											<ul>
												<li><a href="(EmptyReference!)">Habitat affiliates</a> start when concerned citizens of diverse backgrounds come together to address the problem of poverty housing in their community.</li>
												<li>These volunteers research the community&rsquo;s affordable housing needs and resources and evaluate the potential success of Habitat&rsquo;s self-help model in their community.</li>
