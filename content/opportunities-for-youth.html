											<p>Safety is one of our greatest priorities, which is why volunteers must be at least 18 years old to work on our construction sites. But because we welcome everyone in our community to join us in our mission, regardless of age, we invite young supporters to contribute in other ways.</p>
											<p><b>SOD LAYING/LANDSCAPING</b></p>
											<p>Habitat will build 12 to 14 new homes in the next 12 months and needs help to transform each one from a construction site to a beautiful lawn. Anyone age 12 and older can help, with adult supervision. Sod Laying will being in March and continue into April and May. Check back here for the next scheduled event, and contact CD Perez, Coordinator of Volunteers, 352-563-2744 to sign up.</p>
