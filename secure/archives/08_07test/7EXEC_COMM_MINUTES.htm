MEETING</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>HABITAT FOR 
HUMANITY OF CITRUS COUNTY, INC.</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>MINUTES JULY 
15, 2003&nbsp; 3:30 pm</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The meeting was called to order by Norm Peterson, 
President.&nbsp; Present also were John Thrumston, Linda Deptola, Lorna Nimmo , ED&nbsp; 
Michelle Maidlow&nbsp; and Dan Groner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first matter involved information learned from the 
Habitat International website.&nbsp; Since two members of the same family may not 
serve on the Executive Board it has been suggested that the following changes 
take place to the slate of officers:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linda Deptola will serve as 
Secretary</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonnie Peterson will serve as 
Recording Secretary</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many Corporations have more than one Secretary position.&nbsp; 
Linda will take minutes at the Executive BOD meetings and Bonnie will take 
minutes at the general meetings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">MOTION by John Thrumston to accept job description for 
Secretary positions, seconded by Dan Groner, all approved.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finance report was discussed.&nbsp; Michelle has transferred 
records to Quick Books and we will eventually use the Habitrax system provided 
by International.&nbsp; Several questions were asked as to where payments on 
mortgages show and what the beginning balances for escrow accounts indicate.&nbsp; 
Answers were given by both Norm and Michelle.&nbsp; Mr. Peterson passed out 
explanation of escrow accounts.&nbsp; Many are under funded and Mr. Peterson will 
meet with partners to explain situation and resolve.&nbsp; The solution choice will 
be, sub loan to be paid off monthly, refinance of the entire mortgage, or they 
may pay in full to fund the deficit.&nbsp; Some of the problem has been the huge 
increase in insurance costs.&nbsp; It was suggested that during the first year most 
of the payment should go to escrow much as a conventional mortgage.&nbsp; That way we 
would not be in a position of paying insurance and taxes for partners and having 
them pay us.&nbsp; Collett mortgage was paid off and proceeds show in the report.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Peterson expressed a need for the Executive Board to 
understand the Finance Report so as to be able to answer questions at the 
general board meeting.&nbsp; We have also reached the level at which an Audit is 
required by Habitat International.&nbsp; This will be scheduled for February and will 
be in next year’s budget.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Vision Committee was discussed.&nbsp; Gill Brier is Chairperson 
and Bonnie Peterson is Vice-Chair.&nbsp; They will be meeting two to three times per 
month.&nbsp; Chairpersons will be approved at next general board meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Volunteer Appreciation was discussed.&nbsp; There will 
definitely be a picnic for volunteers in the fall.&nbsp; Awards will be planned such 
as “golden hammer”.&nbsp; This will be held annually.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Committee diversity was discussed.&nbsp; It is important to have 
members of many different occupations and nationalities on the Board.&nbsp; Members 
from the Sheriffs Department, media and different ethnic groups were discussed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Executive Board will consider having quarterly meetings 
open to the public at strategic location through out Citrus County in an effort 
to educate the public on our affiliate and the opportunities for volunteers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other committee reports were discussed.&nbsp; By MOTION of Linda 
Deptola, seconded by Dan Groner the approval of Candice King as a partner was 
deselected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">John Thrumston questioned the need for tee shirts to make 
available to volunteers.&nbsp; At this time we could only sell shirts, not give them 
away.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Behuniak family was discussed.&nbsp; They are now 90 days behind 
on mortgage.&nbsp; A plan will be presented by Mr. Peterson to bring them current.&nbsp; 
In the future they will not be allowed to be late even one day.&nbsp; The Behuniaks 
have been made aware of all county facilities that could help them.&nbsp; This entire 
situation will be addressed by a letter from our attorney as it is as important 
to manage this situation properly as it is to collect the money owed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There being no further business to bring before the 
Executive Board a MOTION was made by Dan Groner to adjourn, seconded and 
approved.</p>
