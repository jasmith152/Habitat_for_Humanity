    <h1>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR’S REPORT FOR JULY BOARD MEETING</h1>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>ADMINISTRATIVE:</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This past month has been a whirlwind!&nbsp; I have been 
    working on getting all mortgages into Habitraks, and have had Habitraks 
    training with 2 office volunteers to begin input of all our other data bases 
    that are here and there.&nbsp; We are trying to compile a list of all volunteer 
    interest and abilities, so we have been making a lot of phone calls to 
    determine who is willing to continue volunteering.&nbsp; We still need to get 
    copies of releases that are at the Home Store and the Work site.&nbsp; This will 
    be an ongoing project.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Community Contribution Tax Credit Program 
    Application was filed at Tallahassee, but it doesn’t look promising that we 
    will get any funds.&nbsp; However, we will not be expected to pay Custom Windows 
    back for their donation.&nbsp; I also completed the grant request for Publix 
    charities.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The manuals for the Board of Directors are being 
    put together, but much more needs to be done.&nbsp; It’s been a problem to 
    determine what is current info and what is out of date.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also been trying to get the official 
    records and files up to par.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>COMMUNITY:</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a four- minute TV spot for Key TV.&nbsp; (This 
    was not my idea of fun.)</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">I have another speaking engagement this coming 
    weekend.&nbsp; I have been preparing a speech for that event.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FAMILY SUPPORT:</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had meetings with Mr. Behuniak, and with 
    Candice Patterson.&nbsp; Mr. Behuniak is now three months in arrears.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 
    matter has to go back before the Family Services Committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Patterson 
    has not taken care of her outstanding debts, and has two social security 
    numbers appearing on her credit report.&nbsp; She claims she is a victim of 
    identity theft.&nbsp; I sent her a book put out by the Consumer Credit Counseling 
    Agency on the procedures she needs to follow to correct the problems.&nbsp; A 
    police report has been filed.&nbsp; We have received 8 applicants, which the 
    Family Services Committee has been processing.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><b>FINANCE:</b></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have changed over signators on the Amsouth and 
    Inverness accounts.&nbsp; We still have others to do.&nbsp; We also acquired 
    Quickbooks Pro, and are beginning a transition.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">We have been excused by our ASM, Mary Welch, from 
    conducting our audit this year.&nbsp; One should have been conducted last year as 
    soon as the affiliate went over $500,000, but it wasn’t.&nbsp; February we will 
    be doing an RFP with various CPA firms, and we need to include an audit in 
    our next year’s budget.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
