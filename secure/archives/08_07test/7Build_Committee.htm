    It seems we are outwitting the summers heat. &nbsp; Two steps forward and one 
    back. &nbsp; I'm talking about the humid and rainy weather that has deluged us in 
    recent weeks. &nbsp; We have Kenny taping and plastering and he is doing a 
    diligent job. &nbsp;We just can't get the coats to dry in this humid weather. &nbsp; 
    As of now we will resume working on the 22nd of July, a tuesday. &nbsp; About a 
    week late from our schedule. &nbsp;During this interim the septic system was 
    installed and we contacted the contractor to install the drive and walks.<br>
    <br>
    We met with the Partners for the Roger's home, selected the trees that are 
    to remain and have scheduled Debusk to clear the site. &nbsp; It is possible that 
    because of the elevation, in comparison the street, we may have to go to a 
    stem wall foundation. &nbsp; This is pouring a footing, setting building blocks, 
    filling the cavity with sand, on which the concrete is poured. &nbsp;If this is 
    necessary, we will get a cost for the process and report the amount to the 
    board in our next monthly report.<br>
    <br>
    Norm Peterson, Mike Crusco and I met with a draftsman who has agreed to help 
    us consolidate the drafting and engineering processes. &nbsp; Both are residents 
    of Citrus County. &nbsp; Before we were using an engineer who was located in 
    Clearwater and a draftsman from our county.&nbsp; Our thanks to both parties who 
    helped us in the past. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    For the Committee,<br>
