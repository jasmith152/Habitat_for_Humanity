<p class="MsoNormal">It has come to the attention of the administration that our 
recent election violated a somewhat under published, but a major ruling of HFHI. 
The Financial Affiliate Operating Manual states the following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“<b>Under no circumstances should close relatives serve as 
the President of the board and as either the Secretary or the Treasurer” (ref: 
page 2-4)</b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This issue was discussed with Mary Welch, our Affiliate 
Support Manager, from the Southeast Regional Management Office. To resolve this 
matter we suggested having a Secretary and a Board Recorder. She agreed to this 
solution. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With Linda Deptola also being on the ballot for Secretary I 
discussed the matter with her and Bonnie Peterson. They understood and were 
willing to have Linda resume the position of Secretary, with Bonnie Peterson as 
the Board Recorder. The job description for these two positions is as follows.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Secretary:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="square">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Serves on the Executive Committee</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Maintains copies of the Organizations By Laws and the 
  Boards’ policy statements</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Keeps lists of Officers, Board Members and Committees</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Makes sure there is a quorum at the Board meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Signs Board minutes to attest to their accuracy</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Keeps accurate minutes of Executive Committee meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Maintains copies of minutes of both Board and Executive 
  Committee meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Keeps records of all Board correspondence</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Signs official documents of the organization as required</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Files the Annual return and other Incorporated documents 
  as necessary</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">In absence of the President and Vice President, chairs 
  the Board meetings until the return or the election of an alternate President.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Recorder:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" type="square">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Notify Board members of meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Publish Board meeting agenda</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Keep record of Board attendance</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Keep accurate minutes of Board meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record all motions, action items and decisions of Board 
  meetings</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Record all corrections to Board minutes</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This matter was brought before the Executive Committee. 
They approved of the solution as well and recommended to the board that this 
change be implemented.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Respectfully Submitted</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Norm Peterson</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">President of the Board&nbsp; </p>
